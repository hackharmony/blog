* Summary
- All great investment vehicles start as amazing opportunities.
- Eventually people crowd those investments until the expected reward and risk is priced in.
- All investments equilibriate like this to reach near parity with the next best alternative, e.g., the S&P 500.
* Lifecycle of investments
** The cycle of all successful investment strategies
1. *Genesis*: Someone discovers or invents something big, potentially paradigm-shifting or just a Better Mousetrap. This is the new “Investment Vehicle,” as I will refer to it here. Think personal computers in the early 1990s.
2. *Smart Money*: Early adopters get in (the Smart Money phase). VCs, institutional investors, or just smart individuals start throwing money at this, seeing the potential.
3. *Proof of Concept*: The concept either works or doesn’t. (If it doesn’t, it never makes it past this point, the early adopters lose their investment, and we never hear about the concept since it failed.)
4. *Dumb Money*: Eventually, the masses see the potential too, and crowd in the speculative investment. Consequently, the price of entry into the investment soars.
5. *Critical Mass*: By the time the Investment Vehicle starts producing revenue, the returns paid out to Dumb Money amounts to little more than---or possibly significantly less than---the returns of other mature investment vehicles, whereas Smart Money creates generational fortunes. (Alternate scenario: The Investment Vehicle fails to produce revenue/returns and wipes out Dumb Money, possibly Smart Money too.)
6. *Reversion to Mean*: The Investment Vehicle becomes “commoditized”. Corporations or governments take it over. It produces returns equivalent to any old traditional investment (such as, say, the S&P 500 index), because over time it becomes a traditional investment by definition.

Sound familiar? This is the story of every once Big Thing that landed on economies ever since civilized economies were a thing.

Despite how it may sound, this is not a description of a bubble or Ponzi scheme or a pump-and-dump. It may resemble a Ponzi in that early investors are rewarded. But it doesn’t reward early investors at the direct expense of the investments of the new investors, because it doesn’t dump to zero; it just keeps going up. The phenomenon of the personal computer or the smartphone is the prototypical example of the kind of investment I’m talking about: the PC was undervalued in the beginning because the masses didn’t see the potential. The difference between a bubble and the type of investment I’m talking about is that the new investors don’t suffer for the early investors’ benefit---they just benefit less.
** Examples
- flipping houses
- buying and selling cars
- reselling plastic junk from China
- any publicly traded company before it went public
** Reversion to the S&P 500
Every investment strategy that has anomalous high rewards quickly reverts to those of the S&P 500 once enough people know about it.

At maturity, once-promising investment vehicles turn into traditional investments with the same returns as traditional investments. At worst, they significantly underperform. At best, the returns match those of the S&P 500 (“the S&P 500” being a placeholder for any broad economy-tracking investment vehicle that serves as a benchmark for investment because of its high average performance---it could be the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq or bonds or whatever depending on the current economy). All investments tend toward this measure in equilibrium. Therefore, there are no investment strategies that can “always win”. Winning in investment is rare by design, often the result of luck more than anything. Here I explain why.

Like most economic phenomena, supply and demand are at play. An investment that would be good in the future, but not the present, possesses a non-ideal economic state where the cost of entry into the investment is lower than the expected benefit to its participants (the long-term average return). There are fewer participants on the demand side (investors) in the present, because of the low/nonexistent returns in the present, so the cost of entry must be lower. Obviously no one knows what the future holds. When the future is particularly uncertain (as with some new speculative investment like Ford’s Model T), nothing about the future of the investment can be priced in, i.e., baked into the price already. The sellers of the asset---e.g., Bill Gates selling equity in early Microsoft---are taking a long-term loss in exchange for short-term gain; in other words, early investors are profiting from a discrepancy in forecasting of the future[fn:arbitraging]. This is all an overly pedantic way to say that early investors are speculating on an asset. Bear with me.

[fn:arbitraging] You could say early investors or Smart Money /arbitrage time/, but honestly that’s taking the analogy to cringe levels.

Once the speculative asset proves itself promising to the broader market, the future forecast becomes less speculative; the demand side naturally rises. The cost of entry increases. Wealth is created. As the asset continues to perform up to investor predictions, it will continue to attract new investors, higher and higher demand. When does it peak and demand slow down? When the performance of the investment achieves parity with the next best alternative, which is often the S&P 500 index. (It’s very hard to beat the returns of the S&P 500, which is why relative performance of investments are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(finance)][measured against it]].) Then demand will cool off. Equilibrium will set in. It’s no longer a better-than-average investment. Why? *Because too many people found out about it.*
* The Next Big Thing
The point of our inquiry isn’t necessarily to promote pessimism. Yes, all good investments eventually become not-good investments because too many people hear about them. That’s just an objective fact. You will not make better-than-average money by investing in something a lot of other people are also investing in. If that discourages you from investing (e.g., in some investment strategy [[https://www.tailopez.com/][some charlatan]] convinced you was a Sure Thing), then maybe it’s a good thing you’re discouraged; high false expectations lead to high disappointments. The point of identifying this fact is to use it to discover really good investments. Hardly pessimistic.

The important thing to realize is popularity is inversely correlated to the quality of an investment. /No one gets rich by doing the same thing everyone else is doing/...proven as a straightforward consequence of the definition of “rich” being relative to average wealth.

For instance, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies#Medallion_Fund][only hedge fund]] that has consistently beat the market for decades is private and invite-only. Given the previous discussion, it’s clear why they did this. Suppose they made the fund public. Everyone would immediately crowd into it. They would have to expand their anomalously profitable positions to be able to invest all the new money. This would drive up the price of those positions, making them no longer profitable, eliminating the advantage they once had by taking advantage of superior knowledge about the value of assets that weren’t priced in. The low number of participants is one of the big reasons why the fund performs so well in the first place.

So what do you look for? What’s the Next Big Thing? Based on the previous Next Big Things, there are some patterns: (1) they created new industries, (2) they changed the way most people lived[fn:beneficial], (3) no one predicted them[fn:sounding], and (4) few expected them to be successful.

We already had...

- Money in ca. 5’000 B.C.
- Steel in ca. 200 B.C.
- Guns in ca. 1300
- Oil in 1860
- Airplanes in 1905
- Cars in the 1910
- S&P 500 in 1957
- PCs in 1990
- World Wide Web in 1993
- Smartphones in 2007
- Social Media in 2008
- Bitcoin in 2010
- ... in ???

What’s next?

(Hint: If you think it’s something everyone else would also guess (like “artificial intelligence”), that ain’t it.)

[fn:beneficial] Not necessarily for the better. That was never a requirement.

[fn:sounding] People have a tendency to only predict things that sound cool. People in the 70s predicted moon colonies---not as a consequence of necessity, but moon colonies sure sounded cool, like a sci-fi movie. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near][Ray Kurzweil’s Singularity]] also sounds very cool too, like a sci-fi movie.
