title: The Death of Risk Taking
category: economics
---

# Summary
- Taking (calculated) risk is good and should stop being pathologized.
- The modern era is increasingly characterized by a macro shift toward avoidance of risk.
- Heading toward a future of abolished risk taking is profoundly risky because our only proven mechanism of progress is borne of risk and failure.

# Investing vs. Venture Capital

Thereâ€™s a difference between investing and venture capital. Investing is Coca-Cola stock and the S&P 500. Itâ€™s the healthy distribution of capital that passively supports economic growth as a default. Returns are below 10% and just a substitute for a savings account with interest rates from a previous era. ðŸ’¤

On the other hand, yet still somehow thought of as a subset of the former, venture capital seeks big rewards---like 1000+% returns---as some transcendent strategy on a completely different level from the low-risk, passively-bet-on-the-status-quo paradigm of owning stock in stuff like Geico and Coca-Cola. As an analogy to the late 1800s golden age of the United States, the embodiment of venture capital would have been a successful dentist in Virginia closing his practice to go pan for gold in the California gold rush.

These illustrate two very different approaches to risk. They analogize very well to every level, from your personal decisions to the macro worldwide picture. As a ``venture capitalist'', your outcome space is either Lose A Lot or Win A Lot, but very rarely Just Make A Little All The Time (as long as nothing major happens, in which case you'd be wiped out). Both have their pros and cons. Both need to exist in the world. Take your pick.

# A dangerously risk-averse world

A pessimistic worldview (whether justified in being so or not) would discourage such a high-risk high-reward approach to life. This is actually the consensus, at least in the developed world. In practice, everyone chooses the reliably boring over the volatile, in all walks of life. No one likes taking risks. (I donâ€™t mean frivolous risks that come from impulsivity but calculated risks that are taken despite the risk in the pursuit of great reward.) I think we live in a world that systemically fears risk in a way so unlike any previous era of human history.

- The default investment is index funds.
- Not having car insurance is something you can go to jail for.
- The biggest faux paux you can do in public is smoke cigarettes.
- The most common clickbait article is about X food being bad for you.
- Every major catastrophe (like the Great Recession, 9/11, or the anticipation of a future one caused by climate change) is met with profound, overreaching changes in government without anyone questioning it.
- Trial lawyers. Ignoring the perpetually risk-averse dogma puts a dollar cost on businesses thanks to tort law.
- It is commonly seen as an injustice that health insurance in the United States isn't a right guaranteed by the state.
- Few would be happy about their local police force cutting in half.

My argument obviously isn't that we shouldn't have insurance. Insurance is good. These examples illustrate how far the public consciousness has lowered its risk tolerance as compared to just 100 or less years ago. Obviously we have more technology and resources now, which allows us to offer these guarantees of safety. Of all the mega-trends that have occured in the 20th century, the effect of how much risk (including physical) that the average person faces seems rarely discussed.

Risk aversion ultimately comes from a place of pessimism. A blind optimist would happily take huge risks. *You make your own luck.* That used to be the motto of America in the late 1800s/gold rush era. Something changed. The country stopped becoming a nation of pioneers and more of a nation of settlers. Along with the technological shift that allowed modern-day safety to be possible came a much more pessimistic outlook on the world. In the 1970s everyone believed we would literally be riding hoverboats on Mars by now. Now most of the country is secretly anticipating losing superpower status to China or something. What happened? It's almost like a new New World type of filter has to happen to bring back that bullish empire-building spirit.

# Gambling as simulated risk

Gambling feels good. Why? Allow me to spout some broscience with zero citations. Evolution incentivized the genes that promoted gambling: *We are all descendants of people who took massive risks and happened to succeed*. The prehistoric hominid experience offered many chances to win big for taking big risks. The winners outbred those who didnâ€™t take risks. After countless generations, this converges to everyone being the descendant of a risk taker. (Without getting too philosophical, I would argue that this human impulse to Get Rich Quick is the #1 reason communism is a failure.)

Gambling in its current form is a symbolic simulation of the more visceral risks we would have been inclined to take in the wild. The more technologically advanced a society is, the more gambling games they have (greater than just the effect of having technology to create games). Someone who hunts all day and gets chased by tigers won't want to go home and get more adrenaline from risking stuff on a game of dice. Simulated risk taking is a big sector of our economy. People waste money on lottery tickets. People fly to Las Vegas or Macau. People gamble on sports. Risk taking in this way is a purchaseable commodity. You need not take macro risks in the real world and try to create things at great personal expense---here's a video game or a ticket you can buy that gives you that feeling instead while you remain ``safe''.

# What happens when risk-taking is extinct?

So many people **have to** fail spectacularly for every person that succeeds. Even for every billionaire like Jeff Bezos who was eating ramen while starting Amazon, there are thousands of others just like him who in fact never stopped eating ramen. How many men on oil rigs had to die for you to fly in an airplane? This process, as brutal as it is, is how we got here. It is not obvious that this new age devotion to risk aversion (including physical risk) is capable of fostering the progress we have seen over the past several centuries.

The crucial thing is that a world without continued exponential progress in technology is basically an apocalypse. So many people are born today and so much of our civilization only exists with exponential growth of the global economy taken for granted. If 10 billion people are fighting over loaves of bread, the luxuries that gave us our pathological risk-aversion wouldn't do much to save us.

It's more risky for us to be careful.
