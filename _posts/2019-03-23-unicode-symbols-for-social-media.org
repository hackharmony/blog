title: Unicode Symbols Useful For Social Media
---

* What this is for
This is a list of Unicode symbols / code points that are often used on social media---besides emojis, which are already easy to input.

The symbols themselves are listed alongside their hexademical Unicode code points. For often-used symbols, it’s useful to memorize the numerical code points so that you can input them without having to search engine the symbol (or refer to a webpage like this, which you should bookmark!).

On *Microsoft Windows, macOS, and X11 (GNU/Linux or *BSD)*, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_input#Hexadecimal_input][inputting Unicode symbols by their code points]] is easy with support for native keyboard shortcuts.

In *Emacs*, ~M-x insert-char~.

On *Android or iOS*, as of the time of writing, there is no native equivalent to doing this; you have to use a third-party app or copy/paste from a webpage like this.
