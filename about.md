This is my personal website/blog[fn:good_old_days]. I write articles and tutorials about computer programming mostly, but also a lot of random good thoughts I want to get down.

[fn:good_old_days] Just like the Good Old Daysâ„¢ of Geocities pages.

# Goals

My goal for this website is to produce high signal:noise /useful/ content that readers can put to use---tutorials, software reviews, tips, or investment strategies. I don't like blogs that are pointless shrines to the author's ego. I think that's boring. The market for blogs or social media pages like that is already hyper-saturated. So what you will find on this website are things that will help /you/.

# Monetizing

Compensate me for all the wonderful free content I gave you. ðŸ™ƒ

Give me money (Bitcoin) (â‚¿):
